Created new repo skill `skills/public-metrics-reporting` using the skill-creator workflow.

What was added:

- `SKILL.md` with a concrete workflow for turning Janitr experiment outputs into public-facing summaries.
- `agents/openai.yaml` metadata tuned for public metrics reporting triggers.
- `references/public-copy-templates.md` with TLDR/tweet/release-note templates and a plain-language glossary.

Validation:

- `quick_validate.py` passes for the new skill.
- Prettier check passes for all new skill files.
