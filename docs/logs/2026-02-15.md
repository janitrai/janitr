## 00:08

Compared small transformer (`h128_l4_a4_i512`, int8 eval at `/tmp/small_h128_holdout_eval_int8.json`) against baseline transformer benchmark (`models/benchmarks/2026-02-14_expanded_holdout/transformer/student_holdout_eval_int8.json`).

Observed large gains on the shared holdout support (scam=245, clean=506, topic_crypto=318): scam recall +32.24 pts, scam F1 +21.74 pts, macro F1 +16.28 pts, exact match +14.22 pts, and lower scam FPR by 0.73 pts.

Flagged as likely needing provenance validation because gain magnitude is unusually large versus earlier transformer comparisons.

Backed up full local `models/` directory before commit/push to `/home/bob/model_backups/janitr_models_20260215_091229` (~32G snapshot).

Prepared commit including `data/split_backups/2026-02-14-holdout-expand/*` and today’s SimpleLog updates.
