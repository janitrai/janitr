Planning tiny-transformer implementation doc for janitr. Gathered current context from scripts/prepare_data.py, scripts/prepare_hf.py, scripts/evaluate.py, extension/offscreen.js, extension/background.js, and data/replies\*.jsonl. Key constraint observed: only 14 ground-truth ai_generated_reply rows currently in data/replies.jsonl, so plan will include data expansion + teacher distillation before student deployment.

Created docs/plans/2026-02-13-tiny-transformer-plan.md with a concrete implementation plan for the tiny-transformer option.

Included:

- explicit student architecture (4 layers, hidden 192, 4 heads, seq len 96)
- tokenizer strategy (custom WordPiece 8k)
- data-prep workflow grounded on data/replies.jsonl, data/replies_inferred.jsonl, data/sample.jsonl
- teacher training + distillation + quantization pipeline
- ONNX export acceptance criteria
- extension integration points (background/offscreen/content-script/manifest)
- offline + runtime evaluation gates
- model/bundle size estimates

Ran `npx @simpledoc/simpledoc check` after writing; it failed only on filename convention and suggested renaming to a date-prefixed filename. Kept the user-requested path `docs/plans/2026-02-13-tiny-transformer-plan.md` intentionally.

Reviewed current tiny-transformer plan and baseline Janitr fastText pipeline. Preparing full rewrite of docs/plans/2026-02-13-tiny-transformer-plan.md to target existing scam/topic_crypto/clean classifier, incorporate teacher-model research, and remove all ai_reply references.

Rewrote docs/plans/2026-02-13-tiny-transformer-plan.md to target Janitr's existing scam/topic_crypto/clean classifier instead of ai_reply. Updated dataset baseline counts, teacher model choices (TimeLM primary, BERTweet alternative), distillation strategy (calibration, T=2-4, alpha schedule, hidden-state matching), DAPT/logit-caching plan, extension integration references, script names, evaluation gates, and added updated timestamp.

Ran npx -y @simpledoc/simpledoc check after rewrite. Check failed because docs/plans/2026-02-13-tiny-transformer-plan.md is not date-prefixed per current SimpleDoc naming convention; migration would rename file and update docs/logs references. Kept filename unchanged this turn because user requested direct rewrite of that exact path.
