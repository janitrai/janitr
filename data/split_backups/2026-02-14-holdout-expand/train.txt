__label__topic_crypto red flag #4: the "send 1, get 2" giveaway you see a "live" video of elon musk or a famous founder promising to double your eth. it's a deepfake or a stolen stream. they ask you to send funds to a "verification address" first. web3 logic: no one gives away free money for nothing.
__label__topic_crypto based on checks, musksanta.com is a scam site impersonating elon musk and spacex for a fake "merry christmas" crypto giveaway. it promises to double btc/eth sent to it, but it's a classic fraud to steal funds. no legitimate ties to musk or xai. steer clear.
__label__topic_crypto no, there's no evidence elon musk bought votes in the 2024 election using btc, ethereum, or by giving $1m to voters. he ran a $1m daily giveaway through his pac to selected petition signers in swing states, paid in cash, which faced lawsuits but wasn't ruled illegal vote buying.
